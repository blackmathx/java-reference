Test and explore

1. Look at instance blocks of code. The rule is that static variables/blocks/methods
   in order then instance variables/blocks/methods in order
   
    private gills;
    { int test = gills;}

2. jar command

3.

4. To compile to another target directory: javac -d <folder> packagea/MyClass.java
   To run it: java -cp <classpathOrFolder> packagea.MyClass
   Also -cp = -classpath = --class-path

5. java datatypes. p27

6. Each wrapper  has a valueOf() method such as Boolean.valueOf(true); Double.valueOf(1.0);
   The Integer.parseInt("123"); Double.parseDouble("2.3"); converts strings to primitives

7. Java reserved words p35. var is not a reserved word and may be used as an identifier, it is a reserved type name

8. var question; // DNC p43. final variables can be initialized like this. vars must on the same line
   quesiton = 1; 

9. numeric promotion
  a. java automatically promotes a value to the larger type
  b. if one is integral and other is floating point, java promotes integral to floating points type
  c. smaller types, byte short char, are first promoted to int any time used with binary arithemtic operators even if neither is an int. p75
      example: short x = 10;
               short y = 23;
               var z = x + y; // resulting in int
