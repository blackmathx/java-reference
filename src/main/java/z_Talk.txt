primitives
----------
byte, short, int, long, float, double, char. memorize in order
you get implicit casting from smaller to larger, otherwise explicitly cast them
they can't be null, where objects can be null. consequence is int id != null in an object


Strings
-------
look at all the String methods, changing a String gives a new String.
Then look at StringBuilder. it does not create a new String each modification, instead you call toString()


Numbers
-------
Using numbers, each Wrapper method has a set of methods on it for getting values and casting
look at creating bytes, shorts, ints, longs, floats, doubles
you cant do this> float x = 2.334342; It will interpret as double first then can't cast, use f at the end
look at creating octal digits
look at creating hexidecimal digits
look at binary digits
Look at Math class


Arrays
------
Creating arrays, copying and cloning.
Methods on arrays
compare, mismatch, binary search


Methods
-------
variable access modifiers
order of initialization
no args constructor requirements
abstract methods
interfaces
